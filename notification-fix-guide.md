# Notification System Fix Guide

## 🐛 **Issue Found & Fixed:**

### **Problem**: Socket.IO Connection URL
- **Issue**: Socket.IO was trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1` 
- **Solution**: Fixed to connect to `http://localhost:5000` (removed `/api/v1`)

### **Root Cause**: 
The environment variable `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1` was being used directly for Socket.IO, but Socket.IO needs the base server URL without the API path.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Fixed Socket.IO Connection URL**
```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
const serverUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000';
// This was: http://localhost:5000/api/v1

// After (CORRECT):
const apiBaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:5000/api/v1';
const serverUrl = apiBaseUrl.replace('/api/v1', '');
// This is: http://localhost:5000
```

### **2. Added Better Debugging**
- Added connection URL logging
- Added detailed connection status messages
- Added reconnection handling
- Added admin room join status

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix:**

### **Step 1: Start Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```
**Expected**: Should see:
- `🚀 Server is running on port 5000`
- `🔌 Socket.IO server ready for connections`

### **Step 2: Start Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected**: Should see:
- Vite dev server running
- No console errors

### **Step 3: Check Browser Console**
Open admin dashboard and look for:
- `🔌 Connecting to Socket.IO server: http://localhost:5000`
- `✅ Socket.IO connected to server: [socket-id]`
- `🔌 Socket connected, joining admin room...`
- `✅ Successfully joined admin room`

### **Step 4: Test CV Upload**
1. Upload a CV through the public form
2. **Expected Results**:
   - Backend console: `🔔 Sending CV upload notification to admin room`
   - Frontend console: `🔔 Received new CV upload notification`
   - **Popup notification** appears from right side
   - **Notification count** updates in bell icon

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**

### **Check Socket.IO Connection:**
In browser console, run:
```javascript
// Check connection status
console.log('Socket connected:', window.socketService?.isSocketConnected());

// Check socket instance
console.log('Socket:', window.socketService?.getSocket());
```

### **Check Redux State:**
In browser console, run:
```javascript
// Check notification state
console.log('Notifications:', store.getState().notifications);
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **When CV is Uploaded:**
1. ✅ **Backend receives CV** and saves to database
2. ✅ **Backend emits Socket.IO event** to admin room
3. ✅ **Frontend receives notification** via Socket.IO
4. ✅ **Redux state updates** with new notification
5. ✅ **Popup appears** from right side
6. ✅ **Notification count** updates in bell icon

### **Console Messages to Look For:**
```
🔌 Connecting to Socket.IO server: http://localhost:5000
✅ Socket.IO connected to server: [socket-id]
🔌 Socket connected, joining admin room...
✅ Successfully joined admin room
🔔 Received new CV upload notification: [data]
```

## 🚀 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Check 1: Backend Running**
- Make sure backend is running on port 5000
- Check if Socket.IO server is initialized
- Look for connection logs in backend console

### **Check 2: Frontend Connection**
- Check browser console for connection messages
- Look for any error messages
- Verify the connection URL is correct

### **Check 3: Network Issues**
- Check if port 5000 is accessible
- Check firewall settings
- Try refreshing the page

### **Check 4: Admin Authentication**
- Make sure admin is logged in
- Check if admin has proper permissions
- Verify admin room joining

## 📋 **Quick Test Checklist:**

- [ ] Backend server running on port 5000
- [ ] Frontend running on port 5173
- [ ] Browser console shows Socket.IO connection
- [ ] Admin room joined successfully
- [ ] CV upload triggers backend notification
- [ ] Frontend receives notification
- [ ] Popup appears from right side
- [ ] Notification count updates

## ✅ **The Fix Should Work Now:**

The notification system should now work properly with:
- ✅ **Correct Socket.IO connection** to `http://localhost:5000`
- ✅ **Real-time notifications** via Socket.IO
- ✅ **Popup notifications** from right side
- ✅ **Notification panel** for management
- ✅ **No toast notifications** (as requested)

Try uploading a CV now - you should see the popup notification appear from the right side!
