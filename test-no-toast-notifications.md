## 🔍 **What Was Removed:**

### **Before (with toast):**
```javascript
// Handle new CV upload notifications
const handleNewCvUpload = (notification) => {
  console.log('🔔 Received new CV upload notification:', notification);
  dispatch(addSocketNotification(notification));
  
  // Show toast notification
  toast.success(`New CV uploaded by ${notification.cvData?.name || 'Unknown User'}`, {
    description: notification.message,
    duration: 5000,
  });
};
```

### **After (no toast):**
```javascript
// Handle new CV upload notifications
const handleNewCvUpload = (notification) => {
  console.log('🔔 Received new CV upload notification:', notification);
  dispatch(addSocketNotification(notification));
  
  // Toast notification removed - using popup notifications instead
};
```

## 🚀 **Benefits of This Change:**

1. **Cleaner Interface**: No more intrusive toast notifications
2. **Better UX**: Popup notifications are more elegant
3. **Less Noise**: Admins won't be overwhelmed with toasts
4. **Focused Notifications**: Only important actions show toasts
5. **Consistent Design**: All CV upload notifications use the same popup system

## 📱 **User Experience:**

### **For Admins:**
- **Immediate feedback**: Popup appears instantly for new CVs
- **No interruption**: No toast notifications blocking the interface
- **Clean interface**: Only essential toasts for important actions
- **Full control**: Can manage notifications through the panel

### **For CV Uploads:**
- **Silent notifications**: No toast popups
- **Elegant popups**: Right-side notification popups
- **Auto-dismiss**: Popups disappear automatically
- **Full details**: Shows all CV information

## ✅ **Summary:**

The Sonner toast notifications for new CV uploads have been successfully removed from the admin panel. The notification system now uses only:

1. **Popup notifications** for immediate feedback
2. **Notification panel** for comprehensive management
3. **Toast notifications** only for important admin actions (download, status update, etc.)

This provides a cleaner, less intrusive notification experience while maintaining all the functionality!
